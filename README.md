# KerrQED
Considering first-order QED corrections to the spacetime metric and motion of photons, simulate the image of a rotating black hole with a magnetic monopole by implementing ray-tracing algorithm.

## I. main

All the major files are here in folder [main](https://github.com/ShaobingYuan/KerrQED/tree/main/main).

- Theory

  - Read [KerrQED Theory](https://github.com/ShaobingYuan/KerrQED/blob/main/main/KerrQED%20Theory.pdf).

- Code for Simulation

  - For ray-tracing without QED corrections, use [Kerr Raytracing](https://github.com/ShaobingYuan/KerrQED/blob/main/main/Kerr%20Raytracing.nb);
  - For ray-tracing with QED corrections, use [KerrQED Raytracing](https://github.com/ShaobingYuan/KerrQED/blob/main/main/KerrQED%20Raytracing.nb).

- Results

  - The images and shadows are stored in [Figures](https://github.com/ShaobingYuan/KerrQED/blob/main/main/Figures.nb).

## II. Tools

The code in folder [Tools](https://github.com/ShaobingYuan/KerrQED/tree/main/Tools) may be useful in future research.

## III. Old Code

Find old code in folder [Old Code](https://github.com/ShaobingYuan/KerrQED/tree/main/Old%20Code), which may be helpful in the construction of the new code.
